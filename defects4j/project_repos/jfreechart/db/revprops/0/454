This patch improves the performance of the DefaultKeyedValues by replacing
the single combined key-value-list with separate lists for keys and values
and by adding a key-to-index mapping for faster lookups. 

The implementation behaves a lot faster for read operations and for plain
add operations. It greatly sucks for insert-operations and sort operations.
But people who sort the data after each insert should be shot anyway or 
should implement a better suited version.
